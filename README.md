# FractionJS

Welcome to and thank you for your interest in FractionJS.

## Add As A Submodule

The best way, by far, is to add this as a submodule.

```
git subomdule add https://github.com/jauntyjocularjay/Fractionjs fraction
```

will install the library into your root under fraction: `root/fraction`

## Why Fractions?

Although decimals are the standard for computer science, Fractions can contain information that is lost due to rounding.

3/4 is easily expressed as a decimal : 0.25

3/7 is not easily expressed as a decimal : 0.428571...

Generally the information lost is negligible. However, for some mathematical operations (ex. using Radians) it is much preferable to preserve this information.
