Welcome to and thank you for your interest in FractionJS.

## Why Fractions?

Although decimals are the standard for computer science, Fractions can contain information that is lost due to rounding.

3/4 is easily expressed as a decimal : 0.25

3/7 is not easily expressed as a decimal : 0.428571...

Generally the information lost is negligible. However, for some mathematical operations (ex. using Radians) it is much preferable to preserve this information and this arithmatic is faster.
